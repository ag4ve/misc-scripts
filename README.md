# misc-scripts
These are random scripts I wrote while at Korelogic. Names with an
asterisk (*) are in an unknown state.

## Scripts
- bashpack.pl - packs sourced scripts into one file
- host-vars.example - example file to go along with mon-hosts
- ipt-count-trace - run a command twice and see the iptables counter
difference between the runs
- mon-hosts-packed - the packed up version of mon-hosts
- mon-hosts.sh - a script to monitor/run a command on list(s) of hosts
- sshs.sh - simple script to ssh to a server and determine an appropriate
terminal and attach to the default screen session
- tmux-start - run a command with different parameters in separate tmux
windows (like starting ssh to a bunch of hosts that then uses sshs to open
your screen session there?)
