	* Makefile (1.2): Instead of using TARGET_EXEC_DIR and EXEC_FILES
	  to sometimes mean /usr/local/bin and sometimes /usr/local/sbin
	  (but never both at once), introduced/renamed to TARGET_BIN_DIR +
	  BIN_FILES and TARGET_SBIN_DIR + SBIN_FILES.

	  Required touching any Makefile recipe that mentioned any of those
	  variables.  I think I got them all, and did the right thing, but
	  I could be wrong.
