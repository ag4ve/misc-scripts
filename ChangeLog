	  correct while loop and up/down check.

2015-10-23 12:31  swilson

2015-10-22 18:44  swilson

	  outside of my zsh.

	  environment variable.

2015-09-03 10:54  swilson

	* bashpack.pl (1.1): Initial bash packing script (so that functions
	  we use all the time can be stored in separate files, sourced, and
	  included in deployed scripts). Needs to handle matching quotes
	  and ticks - intentionally does not try to include sourced
	  variables as those can change at runtime.

2015-08-21 05:00  swilson

	* tmux-start.sh (1.5): Send separate commands and attempt not to
	  junk up the shell history too much.

2015-08-13 13:19  swilson

	* tmux-start.sh (1.4): Export a function to make sure a command
	  succeeds vs just waiting an arbitrary time.

2015-08-02 15:57  swilson

	* tmux-start.sh (1.3): Add a sleep (or pause) option as it seems
	  ssh requires a bit of time to establish port forwards.

2015-07-24 06:31  swilson

	* tmux-start.sh (1.2): Add option to append to the command. Correct
	  debug (I do not need levels yet).

	  want to use it.
